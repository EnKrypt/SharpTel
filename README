How it came about.
***********************************************************************

For many reasons, I always wanted to make one of these.
This project is the same as JTel
Which is another project of mine - a Telnet Client in Java
This is just a Language Shift.
And my first Ptoject while learning C#

Can come very handy . 
Can easily be customized to make stuff like
Automated Bots, chat clients etc

***********************************************************************

Whats more?
***********************************************************************

Pretty simple to edit and run
Figure out which parts need to customized and write and read
to/from the socket taking advantage of conditions and blah blah

Instead of the old fashoined command line host/port,
SharpTel prompts you on-screen for it.

************************************************************************

So What is SharpTel?

Telnet in C# .
Simple as that .
